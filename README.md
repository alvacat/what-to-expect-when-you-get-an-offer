## What to Expect When You Get an Offer

You may experience mixed emotions upon receiving a job offer, such as relief that your hard work has paid off and excitement at being asked to join a team. No matter what your initial feelings may be, there are some important steps to do immediately upon receipt.
 
### What Do You Do When You Receive an Offer?

Often times a verbal offer will be extended first – over the phone.  If you are getting close to an offer stage of the interview process, keep your phone handy and answer it – even if you don’t recognize the phone number. You don’t want to miss this important phone call!

First, enthusiastically thank the hiring manager who extended the offer to you. Let them know how much you appreciate it and how excited you are at the prospect of joining their team.  Know that you do not need to accept the offer or make a decision on the spot, and should instead ask for a time frame to let them know your decision.  Quick recap: “Thank you, I’m so excited. I look forward to reviewing the offer details, and getting back to you with any questions!” Do NOT verbally accept an offer unless you intend 100% to take the job.

If they haven’t done so already, request that they send you a written offer/letter of agreement/employment contract. You cannot depend on verbal promises made during the hiring process. This is particularly true should you need to negotiate your offer in the future. Therefore, it is essential you receive and review the written offer before answering "yes." Tell them you’ll read this document over and follow up with any questions. It is not a done deal until you sign a written offer letter!

Next, reach out to your Career Coach ASAP to share your great news and plan a time to discuss and review the job details. Your offer letter should include information on:
 
·   	Title of position and duties

·   	Job location

·   	Start date

·   	Hours of work and type of role:  FT, PT, contract

·   	Compensation

·   	Company Policies, including vacation time, holidays, job-related expenses (if any)

·   	Fringe benefits being offered (if any)
 
### Non-Compete Clauses

It’s possible your job offer may contain some restrictive covenants, sometimes called Non-Compete Clauses. These are legal provisions designed by the company to protect their intellectual property and their business. There may also be sections dealing with other areas such as Indemnification and Non-Disparagement. Read these items very carefully; in accepting this job you may also be accepting future obligations and potential restrictions if you should leave the company and seek employment elsewhere, or if a potential dispute in the future arises. This step is easy to overlook because of how exciting receiving an offer is. The fine print can provide you with information that may impact your future. Your future self will thank you for taking the time to read and make an informed choice.
